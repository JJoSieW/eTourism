# eTourism
Course project

ETourism is a web application that supports users to enjoy their experiences booked online through livestream, 
or to create experiences as eHosts to share travel activity in real-time with audience.
In this system, users can browse all experiences and search experiences by condition to target 
experiences matching their standards. Besides, they can create experiences as eHosts if they have the idea 
of doing a livestream to share the event in public. All users have a profile page to check their purchased or 
created experiences’ lists.
As for the management part of the system, staff have the privilege to check submitted experiences,
while administrators have higher privileges to change user’s type to grant or revoke event audit permissions.
In general, users using the system can have their own accounts and do actions on activities or 
experiences depending on their needs, while managers can change the status or type of events or users.
